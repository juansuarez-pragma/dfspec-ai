# Acknowledgments

DFSpec exists thanks to the contributions and inspiration from several projects and individuals.

## spec-kit

This project is fundamentally inspired by [**spec-kit**](https://github.com/github/spec-kit), GitHub's open-source toolkit for Spec-Driven Development.

spec-kit pioneered the concept of making specifications executable, where "specifications become the source of truth that directly generates working implementations."

### Key Contributors

- **[Den Delimarsky](https://github.com/localden)** - Project lead for spec-kit
- **[John Lam](https://github.com/jflam)** - Foundational research and methodology development

### Methodology Inspiration

DFSpec adapts spec-kit's core SDD workflow for the Dart/Flutter ecosystem:

| spec-kit Command | DFSpec Command | Purpose |
|------------------|----------------|---------|
| `/speckit.constitution` | `memory/constitution.md` | Immutable principles |
| `/speckit.specify` | `/df-spec` | Define requirements |
| `/speckit.plan` | `/df-plan` | Technical planning |
| `/speckit.tasks` | `/df-tasks` | Task breakdown |
| `/speckit.implement` | `/df-implement` | TDD implementation |
